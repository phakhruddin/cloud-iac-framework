# Pulumi Cloud-Agnostic Infrastructure as Code

This directory contains implementations of cloud infrastructure using Pulumi, a cloud-agnostic infrastructure as code tool. It demonstrates how to define and manage cloud resources using both Python and TypeScript.

## Implementations

- [Python Implementation](./python/README.md)
- [TypeScript Implementation](./typescript/README.md)

## Cloud Provider Support

The Pulumi code in this framework is designed to be cloud-agnostic and includes configurations for:

- AWS
- Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## Common Components

Both implementations provide the following cloud infrastructure components:

### Network Module
- Virtual Networks and Subnets
- Firewall Rules / Security Groups
- Public IP Addresses
- Load Balancers

### Compute Module
- Virtual Machines / Instances
- Serverless Functions
- Container Services (Kubernetes, etc.)
- Auto Scaling Groups

### Database Module
- Managed Database Services
- NoSQL Databases
- Caching Services

## Prerequisites

- [Pulumi CLI](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/)
- Cloud provider accounts and credentials
- Language-specific tooling (Python or Node.js)

## Pulumi Installation

```bash
# Using curl
curl -fsSL https://get.pulumi.com | sh

# Verify installation
pulumi version
```

## Getting Started

1. Install Pulumi and set up your cloud provider credentials
2. Navigate to either the Python or TypeScript directory
3. Initialize a new Pulumi stack:
   ```bash
   pulumi stack init dev
   ```
4. Configure your cloud provider:
   ```bash
   # For AWS
   pulumi config set aws:region us-west-2
   # For Azure
   pulumi config set azure:location westus2
   # For GCP
   pulumi config set gcp:project my-project
   pulumi config set gcp:zone us-central1-a
   ```
5. Deploy your infrastructure:
   ```bash
   pulumi up
   ```

## Multi-Cloud Strategy

The Pulumi implementations demonstrate how to:

1. Use a consistent coding style across cloud providers
2. Abstract provider-specific details behind common interfaces
3. Implement infrastructure that can be deployed to multiple clouds
4. Share configuration and state between different cloud environments

## State Management

Pulumi offers multiple options for state storage:

1. Pulumi Service (default)
2. Self-hosted backends (S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCS)
3. Local state file

## Security Best Practices

1. Encryption of secrets using Pulumi's built-in secret management
2. Principle of least privilege for service accounts
3. Network isolation and proper firewall configuration
4. Infrastructure immutability and version control

## CI/CD Integration

The Pulumi code can be integrated with CI/CD systems such as:

1. GitHub Actions
2. GitLab CI
3. CircleCI
4. Jenkins
5. Azure DevOps

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the infrastructure code
2. Preview changes using `pulumi preview`
3. Apply changes using `pulumi up`
4. Destroy resources when no longer needed using `pulumi destroy`
