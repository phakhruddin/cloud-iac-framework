# AWS CDK Infrastructure as Code

This directory contains implementations of AWS infrastructure using the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK). It demonstrates how to define cloud resources using infrastructure as code in both Python and TypeScript.

## Implementations

- [Python Implementation](./python/README.md)
- [TypeScript Implementation](./typescript/README.md)

## Common Components

Both implementations provide the following cloud infrastructure components:

### Network Stack
- VPC with public and private subnets
- Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway
- Route Tables and Security Groups

### Compute Stack
- EC2 instances
- Auto Scaling Groups
- Lambda Functions
- ECS/Fargate Services

### Database Stack
- RDS Instances
- DynamoDB Tables
- ElastiCache Clusters

## Prerequisites

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) configured with appropriate credentials
- [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) installed

## AWS CDK Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install -g aws-cdk

# Verify installation
cdk --version
```

## AWS CDK Bootstrap

Before deploying any stacks, you need to bootstrap your AWS environment:

```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION
```

## Deployment Strategy

The framework supports multiple environments (dev, staging, production) through:

1. Context parameters in `cdk.json`
2. Environment-specific stack configurations
3. Different AWS profiles for different environments

## Security Best Practices

1. Principle of least privilege for IAM roles
2. Encryption at rest for sensitive data
3. Network isolation using security groups
4. Secret management using AWS Secrets Manager
5. Resource tagging for cost tracking and management

## Monitoring and Logging

The infrastructure includes:

1. CloudWatch Log Groups for application logs
2. CloudWatch Alarms for critical metrics
3. X-Ray tracing for distributed applications

## Cost Optimization

1. Use of Auto Scaling for compute resources
2. Reserved instances for predictable workloads
3. Resource cleanup using CDK destroy

## Development Workflow

1. Make changes to the infrastructure code
2. Run `cdk diff` to see changes before deployment
3. Deploy using `cdk deploy`
4. Verify the deployment
5. To clean up resources, run `cdk destroy`
